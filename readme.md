This is a client-server architectural Web App made using flask micro framework webservice which is a Speech to Text web application.
## Folder structure and details:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ __pycache__ (all the python cache will be here. Not important)
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ model.cpython-39.pyc
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py (flask server to receive the audio chunk(request) and return the transcript(response)) 
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py (Models can be trained finetuned here. Includes a function for inferencing which is imported ro main.py) 
â”œâ”€â”€ readme.md (The present text file you are viewing right now)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt (python dependencies)
â”œâ”€â”€ static (folder for managing static files for the UI part)
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ style.css (Basic styling is done here) 
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ js (folder containing javascript files)
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ chunk.js (for creating chunks using vad.js and send them to the server using AJAX)
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ recorder.js (for recording the audio using browser's webrtc)
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ vad.js      (vad is performed in real-time and we can make decisions based on vad using this)
â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.html       (to put together all JavaScript logic and interfacing them to the buttons etc.,).
â””â”€â”€ uploads
    â””â”€â”€ audio.wav       (temporary file in which the audio chunk from the client is stored and processed in the server for the transcript)
```

## For running demo in your PC locally: (make sure you have git in your system)

1. clone this repository </br> ``` git clone https://github.com/Naramkeshav59/SpeechToTextApp/```
2. navigate to SpeechToText folder in the terminal.
3. create a python virtual environment and activate it. refer <a href ='https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html'>virtual environment using venv </a>
4. Install dependencies: </br> ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 
5. Run the flask server </br> ```python main.py```
6. The above will take some time for the first time while running reason being it should download the models. Later it won't take much time.
7. Open <a href = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'> </a> for testing the app.
8. Cheers that's all we have to do ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥‚...
